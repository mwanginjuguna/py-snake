# Eden Snake
The legendary snake game using ``tkinter``.

## Rules of the game
1. The goal is to move the snake around the screen/playground, eat as much food as possible, avoid collision (with self/snake, obstacles, and walls of the playground).
2. The snake grows bigger (adds a body-part) each time it eats food.
3. If the snake collides with itself, or runs into an obstacle, including walls, the player loses the game. GAME OVER!
4. Player can control the snake using the keyboad keys as follows:
    - `W` to move up
    - `S` to move down
    - `A` to move left
    - `D` to move right
5. The game score increases as the snake eats more food. Each food has 5 points and 1 body part.
